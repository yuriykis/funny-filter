    ```
    BINARY_NAME=ff
    GO=/path/to/go
    IP=80.249.99.148
    BW_LIMIT=100kbps
    P_LIMIT=10
    INTERFACE=enp0s5
    ```
4. Run the application with make
    ```sh
    make run
    ```
    ```sh
    make set-bw

    sudo make install
    ```

## Usage
### Commands
The tool supports various commands:

* bandwidth set: Set a bandwidth limit on a specific IP.
* bandwidth unset: Remove a bandwidth limit from a specific IP.
* packets set: Set a packet rate limit on a specific IP.
* packets unset: Remove a packet rate limit from a specific IP.

### Examples

#### Set a bandwidth limit on a specific IP
```sh
ff bandwidth set --dev enp0s5 --ip 80.249.99.148 --limit 100kbps
```
#### Remove a bandwidth limit from a specific IP
```sh
ff bandwidth unset --dev enp0s5 --ip 80.249.99.148 --limit 100kbps
```
#### Set a packet rate limit on a specific IP
```sh
ff packets set --ip 80.249.99.148 --limit 10
```
#### Remove a packet rate limit from a specific IP
